# DiscMathlib
A simple library for a small number of tasks.
Such as:
1) Express √N as a periodic continued fraction and find its rational approximation
2) Compute in a residue ring / modular arithmetic (in Zn) //BUT, i used a stupid method of Modular division and congruence, so if n > 100, it will be error in calculation 😎😎😎
3) Finding roots using extended Euclidean algorithm
