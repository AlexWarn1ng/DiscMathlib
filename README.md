# DiscMathlib
A simple library for a small number of tasks.
Such as:
1) Express √N as a periodic continued fraction and find its rational approximation
2) Compute in a residue ring / modular arithmetic (in Zn)
3) Finding roots using extended Euclidean algorithm

A test report is included in the project files, documenting the verification of functionality and correctness of the library functions.
